# Shipments Tracker #

## Purpose ##
  Shipment management app for the small business owner to keep track of clients, shipments, and expenditures.

## Sub-Heading ##
  A dashboard app for business owners who would like to track their shipments. Useful for self-run shipping businesses.

## Summary ##
  Make tracking clients, shipments, and expenditures easier in one dashboard. Just fill out a short form for each new order.

## Problem ##
  There is no longer a need to manually track clients and shipments or make manual calculations..

## Solution ##
  Through a series of forms, clients and shipments will be added by the user. The client will then appear on a dashboard, and the user can mark when a shipment is complete.

## Quote from You ##
  "It is nice to track things from a dashboard instead of a spreadsheet."

## How to Get Started ##
  Just fill in the client form, and you have your first client tracked.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I enjoyed seeing active clients on the dashboard that shows active shipments. It was also easy to report business expenditures."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Next steps is to implement a login system for the business owner and be able to compile data into CSV or spreadsheet format for exporting and have graphs showing general logistics by month.
